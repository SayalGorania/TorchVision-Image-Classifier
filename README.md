# TorchVision-Image-Classifier
An image classifier using the Torchvision library to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset

## Purpose 💡
This project uses Torchvision to create a simple image classifier using the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Running this project
The CIFAR10_Image_Classifier.py file will use a supported GPU if it is available. If not it will use the CPU. The script also downloads the data so you should not need to download the CIFAR-10 dataset separately.
  
## Install 📑
The following packages will be required:

| Package Name | Version |
| ------------ | ------- |
| Torch        |  2.0.1  |
| Torchvision  |  0.15.2 |
| Matplotlib   |  3.5.3  |
